                Hello there,

                <br><br>My name is Cengiz, welcome to this introduction that marks the beginning of my documented exploration into the world of computer science, with a distinct emphasis on artificial intelligence.

                <br><br>As a young child around 4 years old, I was captivated by the marvels of a computer, thanks to a simple interaction with a webcam. This initial fascination gradually transformed into a profound interest, guiding my academic choices in high school towards computer science.

                <br><br>In the formative stages, I was eager to venture into diverse areas of computing. This led me to acquire knowledge in various programming languages and explore distinct domains such as cybersecurity, virtual reality, digital signal processing, and Raspberry Pi.
                
                <br><br>Upon graduating, I dedicated an entire year to intense learning and research in AI. From understanding the basic concept of linear regression to grasping the complexities of transformer models, I exploited different learning resources like Coursera, textbooks, academic papers, and YouTube videos. This period of intense learning and discovery reinforced my commitment to AI and underlined the importance of continual learning in this rapidly evolving field.
                
                <br><br>Originally, this personal website was conceived as a professional portal, succinctly encapsulating who I am and facilitating easy access to my other professional platforms, such as GitHub and LinkedIn. The idea of a dedicated articles section was inherent from the beginning, envisioned as a space to share my learning process and discoveries in the field of AI.
                
                <br><br>The initial series of articles will retrospectively document my past experiences, shedding light on the various projects I undertook and significant milestones achieved in my learning process. Subsequent articles will serve as an ongoing record of my exploration and findings in the captivating field of AI.
                
                <br><br>My hope is that my experiences, ideas, and insights will provide valuable information, stimulate thought-provoking discussions, and satisfy curiosity.

                <br><br>Thank you for reading.
            </p>
