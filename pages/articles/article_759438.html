                It seems that the bar for education is set higher every year over the past centuries. In the 1800s, any obedient person who's phyiscally capable could become a factory worker while any form of education was a privilege. In the 1900s, a high school diploma was was enough to get a job and support a family. In the 2000s, a bachelor's degree was the minimum requirement for a job. In the past decade, a graduate degree has become the new standard.

                During the senior year of my undergraduate studies, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to pursue a graduate degree or not. I switched to computer science during the latter half of my sophomore year and was getting burned out from the intense course load I had to do in order to graduate on time. I remember asking my CS advisor about my course planning for the upcoming semester, and I was laughed at for finding it unrealistic. Because of this uphil battle of taking several CS classes at once as well as summer classes, my increase in GPA was not as significant as I had hoped, and I had no internship experience.
                <br><br>
                At that time, I decided to go directly into industry and gain some experience for a year or two before applying to graduate school. This seemed like a good plan because all I had to do was getting the first job, in which I could display my skills. But then, it also seemed highly challenging to allocate time for leetcode and job applications while taking classes. Fastforward to the last days of April 2022, 2 weeks before graduating, I was able to find a summer research position which marked the start of my bounceback.

                This was awesome because, even with minimum wage, I could finally support myself, gain work experience, and have the entire summer to cool off from the intense courseload and look for jobs (more on this in a future article). Towards the end of the summer, my student research position turned into a staff position. I was learning a lot, had connections with amazing people at the lab, and was encouraged to apply to graduate school.
                <br><br>
                Towards the end of 2022, I asked professors for recommendation letters, started working on my personal statement, and took the GRE. I was able to learn a lot about the research process, and even though I had no publications yet, I was able to talk about them in my personal statement. I know most grad programs have a minimum GPA requirement, thus I had to show that that number does not define my capabilities. I wanted my professional identity to be about my experiences, skills, and passion for the field. During this time, I was making the most of the opportunities I had at the lab by self-studying AI/ML, engaging with the other grad students, and joining weekly workshops and lab meetings. Additionally, I made a personal website, revamped my LinkedIn, and was in a constant state of polishing my resume.
                <br><br>
                I sent my first application in December 2022 and my last one in June 2023. I was accepted to 2 of my top 3 schools, Georgia Tech being my top choice. My initial reaction was a mix of excitement and relief. I was excited because I was going to be a graduate student at a top 10 CS school, and relieved because I was finally done with the application process and can put that time into my personal studies.
