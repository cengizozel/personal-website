            In the domain of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, the project SAPIEN (Synthetic Anthropomorphic Personal Interaction ENgine) represents a significant advancement. It is a language model-driven coaching platform, capable of engaging in open-domain conversations in real-time with users in 13 different languages. I was part of the research team that developed this high-fidelity virtual agent platform.
            <br><br>
            The platform's unique aspect is its ability to simulate emotions that are reflected in the virtual agent's voice and facial expressions. Moreover, it offers users the option to personalize the virtual agent according to their preferences, including the choice of the agent's personality, background, and conversational context.
            <br><br>
            Utilizing state-of-the-art models in Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Large Language Models, SAPIEN virtual agents are able to provide a nuanced and immersive experience. The agent fluently converses in various languages and accurately reflects emotional states. Our team integrated the capability of mimicking seven basic emotions such as Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Afraid, and Disgusted. This attribute significantly enhances the interaction experience, making it more relatable for users across the globe.
            <br><br>
            Upon concluding their interaction with the SAPIEN virtual agent, users may choose to have their conversation analysed to gain personalized feedback on their communication skills. This feedback derives from the conversation's transcript, analysed in relation to a user's specified goal. It identifies their communicative strengths and weaknesses, providing actionable recommendations for improvement. This mechanism leverages the flexibility of the virtual agent's persona and adaptability to a range of applications, including language learning, communication training, and professional applications such as healthcare, sales, and leadership training.
            <br><br>
            I contributed to the task of designing user experiences, particularly the customization of intellectual and emotional traits of AI agents, initiating dynamic conversations, and automated feedback. My work also extended to addressing the responsible use of this technology, considering the ethical implications of such realistic virtual agent representations.
            <br><br>
            We envisaged SAPIEN to be a tool of great potential in the evolving job market. As technical capabilities of Large Language Models increase, "soft" human skills are becoming more desirable. Hence, SAPIEN is designed to help people adapt by fostering human skills through AI.
            <br><br>
            In the future, SAPIEN aims to augment our capacity for communication, empathy, and understanding. However, its design also prioritizes user safety and ethical considerations. This includes measures such as refraining from retaining memory of previous interactions and limiting conversations to a 10-minute timeframe with a warning at the 8-minute mark. Mechanisms are in place to allow the virtual agents to terminate the call if a user shows aggressive or offensive behavior.
            <br><br>
            This project showcases the potential of Large Language Models and human-computer interaction, setting a new paradigm for virtual human-based learning and communication development.
